<p class="text"><em>"I, Rakshitha Leo have always been extremely fond of books and Reading has always been my euphoria. An escape to life and all there is to it by entering a world of fantasy and magic where imagination isnâ€™t contained, dreams are realised and characters that one can always relate to in every way/shape or form, is a feeling of nostalgia that I always go back to. Having inculcated this habit/way of living since the tender age of 8, books have had a huge impact on the person that I am today". <em></p>
